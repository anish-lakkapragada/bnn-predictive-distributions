# Code for [*What if we didn't need to approximate posteriors?*](https://anish.lakkapragada.com/posts/vc-rademacher-test/)


- `blr.py` provides code for deriving the exact posterior, as per Bayesian Linear Regression. 
- `cavi.py` provides code for learning an approximate posterior, through coordinate-ascent variational inference (CAVI)
- `predictive_distributions.py` and `predictive_distributions_animation.py` help us visually compare the predictive distributions
